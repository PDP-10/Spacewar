### Information the LDS-1 version

> LDS-1 Spacewar was amazing to watch, though it looked like it took quite a lot of practice to play.  There was a box with a row of toggle switches (maybe 16 or 18 of them?) and you used them to control the ships.  The ships could move around freely on the screen, iirc there was a star (sun) in the middle of the screen whose gravitational force was a game parameter, and other cool things like that.  I don't know of any modern video game anything like it.
